The utility receives Postgres Query Plans from `psql` and sends them to a visualizer for sharing. 
It will compute and highlight the most important information to make them easier to understand.

## Installation

#### Precompiled binary (Linux)
It's highly recommended installing a specific version of the `plan-exporter` available on the [releases page](https://github.com/agneum/plan-exporter/releases).

To quickly install the tool on Linux, download and decompress the binary, use an example:

```bash
wget https://github.com/agneum/plan-exporter/releases/download/v0.0.3/plan-exporter-0.0.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf plan-exporter-0.0.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv plan-exporter-*/plan-exporter /usr/local/bin/
rm -rf ./plan-exporter-*
```

#### Build from sources
Version `1.13+` is required.

``` 
git clone git@github.com:agneum/plan-exporter.git
cd plan-exporter
go install github.com/agneum/plan-exporter
```
On default, make install puts the compiled binary in `go/bin`.
